# NYC-Climate-Change

  Climate change is defined as the average weather in a place over many years. In particular, it
relates to the drastic change that shows up from the mid to late 20th century onwards. This is due
to the large levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide produced by the use of fossil fuels. Air
pollutants contribute to climate change by affecting the amount of incoming sunlight that is
reflected or absorbed by the atmosphere. Interestingly enough the global average temperature has
risen by about 0.89Â°C over the period 1901 to 2012.
  Therefore, an increase in air pollutants leads to global warming. There is a hypothetical theory
with data to prove it. There are many impacts on the Environment and different factors that are
changing due to climate change. For example, the temperature is fluctuating and the pollutant
ozone as well.
  In this project, we accumulate data to show the correlation between increasing temperature
and degrading air quality due to the depletion of the ozone. As well, with this, we can create a
predictable model that predicts the ozone based on temperature. This project was done on RStudio.
